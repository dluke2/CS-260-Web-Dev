CS 260 Web Dev for Winter 2023

Startup Application:

Sales Pitch:
Have you ever tried to split the cost of something, when several people paid for it? For example, difficulty can arise when separate people have booked lodging or paid for food during a trip. The Expense Splitter application makes it so groups of people can record expenses for an event, then calculate the amount each person needs to pay to even out the expenses across the group. Once the calculation is complete, the group can be sure that everyone has paid their fair contribution to the event.

Key Features:
- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability for admin to create new and delete old events
- Ability for admin to add or remove participants from events
- Ability for participants to input expenses (description and amount)
- Ability to edit expenses
- Live calculations
- Store results

Caddy:
Learning VI is a much faster way of opening and making edits to files. It also doesn't require me to download things off of a server, then pushing changes.
